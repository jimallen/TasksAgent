# Task List: Filter Button Counters Implementation

## Relevant Files

- `obsidian-plugin/src/taskDashboard.ts` - Main dashboard component (MODIFIED - added filter count logic)
- `obsidian-plugin/src/taskDashboard.spec.ts` - Unit tests for dashboard functionality (TO BE CREATED)
- `obsidian-plugin/styles.css` - Styles for filter buttons and badges (MODIFIED - added badge styles)
- ~~`obsidian-plugin/src/types/dashboard.ts`~~ - Type definitions added directly to taskDashboard.ts

## Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED FEATURES:
1. **Filter Counts Interface** - Added `FilterCounts` type with all count properties including overdue
2. **Count Calculation** - `calculateFilterCounts()` method handles all filter types
3. **Badge UI Components** - Created reusable `createBadgeElement()` with zero-count hiding
4. **Integration** - Badges integrated into filter buttons with proper data attributes
5. **Dynamic Styling** - Color-coded badges with active/inactive states and hover effects
6. **Real-time Updates** - Counts update on task changes with 150ms debouncing
7. **"My Tasks" Support** - Counts respect the current view mode filter
8. **Past Due Filter** - Added new "Past Due" filter button with overdue task support

### ‚ö†Ô∏è REQUIRES MANUAL TESTING:
- Theme compatibility (light/dark modes)
- Visual appearance in actual Obsidian environment
- Performance with large task counts (200+ tasks)

### üìù TESTING NOTES:
- Unit tests require Jest setup in Obsidian plugin environment
- Manual testing needed for visual verification
- Follow existing TypeScript patterns and strict mode
- Ensure all changes are compatible with Obsidian's plugin API

## Tasks

  - [ ] 4.7 Test styling with both light and dark Obsidian themes (MANUAL TESTING REQUIRED)

- [x] **5.0 Implement Real-time Updates**
  - [x] 5.1 Add `updateFilterCounts()` method to recalculate and update badge displays
  - [x] 5.2 Call `updateFilterCounts()` after initial task load in `loadAndDisplayDashboard()`
  - [x] 5.3 Update counts when switching between "All Tasks" and "My Tasks" in toggle handler
  - [x] 5.4 Update counts after marking tasks complete/incomplete
  - [x] 5.5 Update counts after manual refresh button click
  - [x] 5.6 Implement debouncing for rapid updates to prevent UI flicker

- [ ] **6.0 Write Unit Tests**
  - [ ] 6.1 Create test file `taskDashboard.spec.ts` if it doesn't exist
  - [ ] 6.2 Write tests for `calculateFilterCounts()` with various task arrays

  - [ ] 6.4 Test "My Tasks" mode filtering affects on counts
  - [ ] 6.5 Test count accuracy for each filter type
  - [ ] 6.6 Test edge cases (empty task array, all completed, no assignees)
