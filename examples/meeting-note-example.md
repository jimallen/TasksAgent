## Email Details

**From:** product@example.com
**To:** engineering@example.com, design@example.com
**Participants:** Sarah Chen, Mike Rodriguez, Alex Kim, Jordan Taylor

**Meeting Summary:**
Sprint planning session to prioritize mobile app features for Q1. Team discussed offline mode implementation, push notification system, and biometric authentication. Agreed on technical approach and story point estimates.

## Action Items

### 🔴 High Priority

- [ ] Design offline data sync architecture [[@Mike Rodriguez]] 📅 2025-01-20 🔴 🧩 cluster:offline-mode ⚠️ 95% #architecture
  - Context: Need architecture review before implementation starts
  - Depends on: Database schema finalization
  > "Mike, can you present the sync architecture to the team by Friday?"

- [ ] Implement biometric authentication for iOS [[@Alex Kim]] 📅 2025-01-25 🔴 🧩 cluster:auth-security ⚠️ 92% #ios #security
  - Context: Touch ID and Face ID support required for v2.0 launch
  - Story Points: 8
  > "High priority for security-conscious enterprise customers"

- [ ] Create push notification service integration [[@Jordan Taylor]] 📅 2025-01-22 🔴 🧩 cluster:notifications ⚠️ 88% #backend
  - Context: Firebase Cloud Messaging integration
  - Must coordinate with mobile teams for testing

### 🟡 Medium Priority

- [ ] Update mobile app icon set for dark mode [[@Sarah Chen]] 📅 2025-01-28 🟡 🧩 cluster:ui-polish ⚠️ 85% #design
  - Context: Current icons don't meet contrast requirements in dark mode
  - Story Points: 3

- [ ] Write unit tests for offline queue manager [[@Alex Kim]] 📅 2025-01-30 🟡 🧩 cluster:offline-mode ⚠️ 82% #testing
  - Context: Critical path functionality needs comprehensive test coverage

- [ ] Document push notification payload format [[@Jordan Taylor]] 📅 2025-01-27 🟡 🧩 cluster:notifications ⚠️ 78% #documentation
  - Context: Mobile teams need spec for notification handling

### 🟢 Low Priority

- [ ] Research competitor offline mode implementations [[@Sarah Chen]] 📅 2025-02-05 🟢 ⚠️ 70% #research
  - Context: Benchmark against industry best practices

## Next Steps

### For This Sprint
1. Architecture review session scheduled for Thursday 1/18
2. Daily standups at 10am to track offline mode progress
3. Security audit for biometric auth by end of sprint

### Future Considerations
- Investigate offline map caching for location features
- Plan for conflict resolution in offline sync scenarios
- Consider implementing background sync for better UX

## Technical Notes

**Offline Mode Approach:**
- SQLite for local storage
- Conflict resolution: last-write-wins with user override option
- Sync triggers: app launch, network reconnect, manual refresh

**Push Notifications:**
- Rich notifications with images and actions
- Silent notifications for background data sync
- Notification categories for user preferences
