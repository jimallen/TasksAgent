# Task Format Guide

Complete reference for task metadata and formatting used by the Obsidian Meeting Tasks Plugin.

## Basic Task Format

```markdown
- [ ] Task description [[@Assignee]] 📅 2025-01-20 🔴 🧩 cluster:id ⚠️ 92% #tag
  - Context: Additional information
  > "Quote from email or meeting"
```

## Metadata Components

### 1. Checkbox `- [ ]`
Standard Obsidian task checkbox
- `- [ ]` = Incomplete task
- `- [x]` = Completed task (click in dashboard to complete)

### 2. Assignee `[[@Name]]`
Task owner extracted from email content
- Format: `[[@First Last]]` or `[[@Team Name]]`
- Examples: `[[@Sarah Chen]]`, `[[@DevOps Team]]`, `[[@Marketing]]`
- Dashboard shows "My Tasks" filtered by your configured name

### 3. Due Date `📅 YYYY-MM-DD`
Extracted from natural language in emails
- Format: `📅 2025-01-20`
- Triggers "Past Due" and "This Week" filters
- Claude extracts from phrases like:
  - "by Friday"
  - "end of month"
  - "January 20th"
  - "in two weeks"

### 4. Priority Emoji
Visual priority indicator
- 🔴 High Priority - Urgent, blocking, or critical tasks
- 🟡 Medium Priority - Important but not urgent
- 🟢 Low Priority - Nice to have, future considerations

Extracted from context like:
- "urgent", "asap", "critical" → 🔴
- "should", "important" → 🟡
- "when you have time", "eventually" → 🟢

### 5. Cluster ID `🧩 cluster:id`
Persistent cluster identifier
- Format: `🧩 cluster:offline-mode`
- Auto-generated by clustering algorithm
- Enables auto-restore of clusters on dashboard load
- Manually editable (change the ID to move between clusters)
- Optional - only present if task has been clustered

### 6. Confidence Score `⚠️ 92%`
AI extraction confidence level
- Range: 0-100%
- Higher score = more certain about task details
- Factors affecting confidence:
  - Clear assignee mention (high)
  - Explicit due date (high)
  - Vague descriptions (low)
  - Ambiguous context (low)

### 7. Tags `#tag`
Category or project identifiers
- Format: `#engineering` `#security` `#frontend`
- Can include multiple tags
- Extracted from email subject and content

### 8. Context Indent `  - Context:`
Additional task information
- Indented under main task
- Provides background or rationale
- Extracted from surrounding email text

### 9. Quoted Text `  > "Quote"`
Direct quotes from email
- Preserves exact wording from source
- Maintains attribution and context
- Helpful for understanding intent

## Complete Examples

### Minimal Task
```markdown
- [ ] Review pull request
```
No assignee, no date, no priority = lowest metadata extraction confidence

### Typical Task
```markdown
- [ ] Review pull request [[@Alex]] 📅 2025-01-18 🟡 ⚠️ 85% #code-review
```
Clear assignee, due date, medium priority, good confidence

### Rich Task with Context
```markdown
- [ ] Implement offline sync architecture [[@Mike]] 📅 2025-01-25 🔴 🧩 cluster:offline ⚠️ 95% #architecture #mobile
  - Context: SQLite for local storage, last-write-wins conflict resolution
  - Depends on: Database schema finalization
  > "Mike, this is critical for the Q1 release - let's discuss the approach in tomorrow's standup"
```
Maximum metadata, high confidence, full context preservation

### Clustered Task
```markdown
- [ ] Write unit tests for sync [[@Alex]] 📅 2025-01-30 🟡 🧩 cluster:offline ⚠️ 88% #testing
```
Same cluster ID (`offline`) groups it with related tasks

## Task Organization in Notes

### By Priority Section
```markdown
## Action Items

### 🔴 High Priority
- [ ] Critical task 1 [[@Owner1]]
- [ ] Critical task 2 [[@Owner2]]

### 🟡 Medium Priority
- [ ] Important task 1 [[@Owner3]]

### 🟢 Low Priority
- [ ] Nice to have [[@Owner4]]
```

### Next Steps Section
```markdown
## Next Steps
- [ ] Follow up on feature X
- [ ] Schedule review meeting
- [ ] Update stakeholders
```
Often lower confidence (no explicit assignees or dates)

## Dashboard Filters

### Filter: High Priority (🔴)
Shows only tasks with 🔴 emoji

### Filter: Medium Priority (🟡)
Shows only tasks with 🟡 emoji

### Filter: Past Due (⏰)
Shows tasks where `📅 date < today`

### Filter: This Week (📅)
Shows tasks where `📅 date` is within next 7 days

### Filter: Delegated (👥)
Shows tasks assigned to others (not your name)

### Filter: Done (✅)
Shows completed tasks `- [x]`

### Multi-Filter
Combine filters with OR logic:
- High Priority + Past Due = urgent overdue tasks
- Medium Priority + This Week = important near-term work

## Editing Tasks

### In Note Files
Edit directly in markdown - full manual control
```markdown
- [ ] Original task [[@Bob]]
```
↓
```markdown
- [x] Updated task description [[@Alice]] 📅 2025-01-30 🔴
```

### In Dashboard
- Click checkbox to mark complete
- Click task text for inline editing
- Click cluster title ✏️ button to rename cluster
- Changes sync back to source markdown files

## Best Practices

### For Maximum Extraction Accuracy
1. **Use clear assignees:** "Sarah, can you..." or "DevOps team should..."
2. **Explicit dates:** "by Friday, January 20th" better than "soon"
3. **Priority keywords:** "urgent", "critical", "when you have time"
4. **Action verbs:** "Implement", "Review", "Update" vs. "We should think about"

### For Better Clustering
1. **Use consistent terminology** across related emails
2. **Include project names** in task descriptions
3. **Group related emails** with same Gmail label
4. **Re-cluster periodically** as projects evolve

### For Dashboard Efficiency
1. **Configure "My Name"** in settings for accurate "My Tasks" filter
2. **Use multi-filters** to focus on specific work
3. **Toggle cluster view** to see project-level organization
4. **Edit cluster titles** to match your team's terminology

## Technical Notes

### Confidence Score Calculation
Based on multiple factors:
- Assignee clarity (30%)
- Date explicitness (25%)
- Priority indicators (20%)
- Task description quality (15%)
- Context availability (10%)

### Cluster ID Generation
- Based on semantic similarity of task descriptions
- Considers source email context (first 500 chars)
- Uses Claude AI for intelligent grouping
- Persistent across sessions via markdown storage

### Date Parsing
Supports various formats:
- ISO: `2025-01-20`
- Natural: "Friday", "next week", "end of month"
- Relative: "in 3 days", "two weeks from now"
- Contextual: Uses email date as reference point
