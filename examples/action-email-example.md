The Q4 security audit has identified several critical vulnerabilities that require immediate attention. Please review your assigned action items and complete them by the specified deadlines. All fixes must go through security review before deployment.

## Action Items

### 🔴 High Priority

- [ ] Rotate all production API keys and secrets [[@DevOps Team]] 📅 2025-01-17 🔴 🧩 cluster:security-critical ⚠️ 98% #security #urgent
  - Context: Several API keys found in public repositories
  - Impact: Critical security risk
  > "URGENT: Complete by end of week to prevent potential breach"

- [ ] Update authentication library to v4.2.1 [[@Backend Team]] 📅 2025-01-19 🔴 🧩 cluster:security-critical ⚠️ 95% #security #backend
  - Context: CVE-2024-12345 - Session fixation vulnerability
  - Requires: Regression testing before deployment

- [ ] Implement rate limiting on login endpoint [[@API Team]] 📅 2025-01-20 🔴 🧩 cluster:security-critical ⚠️ 92% #security #api
  - Context: Currently vulnerable to brute force attacks
  - Recommended: 5 attempts per 15 minutes per IP

### 🟡 Medium Priority
