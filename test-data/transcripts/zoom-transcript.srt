00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
David Thompson: Welcome to the engineering standup. Let's do a quick round of updates.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Emma Wilson: I'll go first. I completed the API integration yesterday. Running final tests today.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:28,000
David Thompson: Excellent. Any blockers?

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Emma Wilson: No blockers, but I need to update the documentation. Will do that this afternoon.

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:55,000
James Lee: For my update, I'm still working on the database migration. Should be done by tomorrow.

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:10,000
David Thompson: James, do you need any help with that?

7
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:25,000
James Lee: I think I'm good, but I'll let you know if I run into issues. I'll also need to create a rollback plan.

8
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:40,000
David Thompson: Good thinking. Make sure to document the rollback procedure.

9
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Emma Wilson: I can review the migration script if you want a second pair of eyes.

10
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:10,000
James Lee: That would be great, Emma. I'll send it to you later today.

11
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:25,000
David Thompson: Perfect. I'll handle the deployment coordination with DevOps.

12
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:40,000
David Thompson: Also, we need to schedule the security audit. I'll reach out to the security team today.

13
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Emma Wilson: Should we include the new API endpoints in that audit?

14
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:10,000
David Thompson: Absolutely. Good catch. I'll make sure they're included.

15
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:25,000
James Lee: I'll also prepare the performance benchmarks before the deployment.

16
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:40,000
David Thompson: Great. Let's recap the action items:

17
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:55,000
David Thompson: Emma will update API documentation and review James's migration script.

18
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:10,000
David Thompson: James will complete the database migration and create a rollback plan.

19
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:25,000
David Thompson: I'll coordinate with DevOps and schedule the security audit.

20
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:35,000
David Thompson: James will also prepare performance benchmarks.

21
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Emma Wilson: Sounds good. Same time tomorrow?

22
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:55,000
David Thompson: Yes, let's keep the daily standups going this week.

23
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:05,000
James Lee: Works for me. See you all tomorrow.

24
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:15,000
David Thompson: Thanks everyone. Have a productive day!
