Date: January 15, 2024
Participants: Alice Johnson, Bob Smith, Charlie Davis

[00:00:00] Alice Johnson: Good morning everyone, let's get started with our Q1 planning session. We have a lot to cover today.

[00:01:30] Bob Smith: Thanks Alice. I'll start by reviewing our Q4 results. We exceeded our targets by 15%, which gives us good momentum going into Q1.

[00:03:00] Charlie Davis: That's great news. Based on that success, I'll prepare the updated revenue projections for Q1. I can have those ready by end of week.

[00:04:15] Alice Johnson: Perfect, Charlie. Action item: Charlie will prepare Q1 revenue projections by Friday, January 19th.

[00:05:00] Bob Smith: For the product roadmap, we need to prioritize the new authentication system. I'll handle the technical specification document and share it with the team by next Tuesday.

[00:06:30] Alice Johnson: Good. Let's make sure we include the security team in that review. Bob, can you schedule a meeting with them?

[00:07:00] Bob Smith: Will do. I'll set up a security review meeting for next week.

[00:08:00] Charlie Davis: We also need to address the budget for the new hires. I think we should allocate resources for 3 engineers and 1 designer.

[00:09:30] Alice Johnson: Agreed. Let's make that a priority. Charlie, please work with HR to draft the job descriptions. We need to start recruiting ASAP.

[00:11:00] Bob Smith: I'll also create a technical interview process document to ensure consistency. Should have that done by end of month.

[00:12:30] Alice Johnson: Great. One more thing - we need to schedule customer feedback sessions. I'll reach out to our top 10 customers and arrange calls for next month.

[00:14:00] Charlie Davis: I can help with that. I'll prepare a feedback survey to send out before the calls.

[00:15:00] Alice Johnson: Perfect. Let's summarize our action items:
1. Charlie: Q1 revenue projections by Friday
2. Bob: Technical spec for auth system by Tuesday
3. Bob: Schedule security review meeting
4. Charlie: Work with HR on job descriptions
5. Bob: Create interview process document by end of month
6. Alice: Schedule customer feedback sessions

[00:16:30] Bob Smith: Sounds good. Should we set up a follow-up meeting?

[00:17:00] Alice Johnson: Yes, let's meet again next Monday at 2 PM to review progress.

[00:17:30] Charlie Davis: Works for me. I'll send out the calendar invite.
