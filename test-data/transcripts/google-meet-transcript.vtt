00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
<v Sarah Chen>Hello everyone, thanks for joining the product sync.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.000
<v Mike Roberts>Hi Sarah, I have the latest metrics ready to share.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:20.000
<v Sarah Chen>Great! Let's start with the user engagement numbers.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:35.000
<v Mike Roberts>Our DAU increased by 23% this month. The new onboarding flow is working really well.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:45.000
<v Lisa Park>That's fantastic! I'll update the investor deck with these numbers today.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:01:00.000
<v Sarah Chen>Thanks Lisa. Mike, can you also prepare a detailed analysis of the user retention cohorts?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:15.000
<v Mike Roberts>Sure, I'll have that analysis ready by Wednesday. Will include the segment breakdown you requested.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:30.000
<v Lisa Park>I also need to schedule the board presentation. Sarah, are you available next Thursday?

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:40.000
<v Sarah Chen>Thursday works. Let's book 2 hours. We need to cover Q1 results and Q2 planning.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:02:00.000
<v Mike Roberts>Speaking of Q2, we should prioritize the mobile app improvements. I'll draft a proposal this week.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:15.000
<v Sarah Chen>Agreed. That's a critical initiative. Include timeline and resource requirements.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:30.000
<v Lisa Park>I'll review the budget allocations and make sure we have funding secured.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:45.000
<v Sarah Chen>Perfect. Let me summarize our action items:

00:02:45.000 --> 00:03:00.000
<v Sarah Chen>Lisa will update the investor deck today and review budget allocations.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:15.000
<v Sarah Chen>Mike will prepare the retention analysis by Wednesday and draft the mobile app proposal.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:25.000
<v Sarah Chen>I'll coordinate the board presentation for next Thursday.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:35.000
<v Mike Roberts>Sounds good. Should we invite the engineering team to the next sync?

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:45.000
<v Sarah Chen>Yes, let's include them. We'll need their input on the mobile app timeline.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:55.000
<v Lisa Park>I'll send the invite. Same time next week?

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:05.000
<v Sarah Chen>Yes, that works. Thanks everyone, great meeting!
